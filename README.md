# Demo-2024-Feb
1-feb
Welcome to the new month in the year 2024 , LETS GO HARDER THAN LAST MONTH , AND BUILD MORE!!.

Going to continue with the e-commerce project this month just to make sure pending issues are resolved then after move forward 
My main Goal for this month is to focus on back-end and go deeper into back-end , maybe learn a little bit of react as well ,and prompt enginnering.
Well there is alot to do this year and this month, wish me luck. 

2-feb
i have decided to spread my time and increase my work hours his month steping up from 3 to 5 hours daily to 8 hours daily , lets see how that goes
also got my updates here i am going to atarting adding dates to my updates just incase i need to come back to something and need to remember the days i updated.

3-feb
its a new day lets get more work done and figure out the signup and loggin UI issue with my e-commerce site
login and signup still not working on UI only through API tesing from API, will just leave it that way and come back to it 
now i will go back to study node.js and understand more about it.
learning new things while diving deeper into node.js , learnt more about operating systems (os) and file systems (fs)
and also a different way to import and export modules , using tthe destructuring way which will take some time to get used to 
learnt aomething new also called streams and buffers , also pipe which is in relation to these two things  
this is just a brief. 

4-feb
not doing much today , just reviewing all my notes that i have taken , both in my books and on my note pad 
gathering some strenght to begin my 8 hours again , lets go crazy this new week because there wont be another week like this again. 

5-feb
active  at 5am on my for my 8hour daily dose.
refreshed on how to create servers with node and express and , i have been using node but extress seems much more better and easier ,even the syntax. 
also my nodemon finally running as it should , i was using the wrong syntax anyways , and now i know the right way to do it , which again makes restarting servers easier 
did not know how to handle redirection , now i know how to in both node and express.
the major thing to do now is practice , practice , practice , i can only get better by actuallly do it instead of just studing and knowing. 

6-feb
another 8hour daily dose. 

7-feb 
learning about view engines , which allow me use javasctipt in html , i would say it is a bit better than html.
it is helpful but i dont think it is required all the time , i might use it to build a full project soon without html and see how it goes
the engine view i have use so far is (ejs) there are three others like pug , handlebers etc.
also learnt partials.

8-feb 
learnt about middlewares , they are codes that run through req ,and response , reguardless of thier routes 
you have to be careful when using middlewares because they run from top to buttom.
Also learnt about 3rd party middleswares , they are external middle packages that help us carry out certian functions , examples validation , logging and many others.
learnt about "static" function that help us explicitly set out static files and images so our server can read them and use them.

9-feb
learning a new databse (MongooDB) , it is a Non SQlL database.
it is a bit similar but different from MySQL database , it has different terminologies and and concepts behind it.
Some of the terminologies behind it are , Collections , Schemas , and Models.
One of the reasons i am enjoying working with MongoDB is , it is the first Cloud based Databse i am working with (MongoDB Atlas).
When working with MongoDB there is 3rd party package we work with and it is called mongoose (funny right) now lets practice. 

10-feb
MongoDB going well so far , been practicing and trying to use it often. 
i dont need to master the syntax of code because there is so much to learn , just understand the syntax and the basics. 
i will work with soo many new technologies so trying to know every syntax would be stressful
so each new techonolgy i learn i just need too practice it often and it will stick then understand the basics main function of how it works and its basics. 
practice makes perfect , still need to figure out why my data is not sending to the right collection / database on my cloud database.

11-feb
taking a little break today , to gather a strenght for another 8hr daily dose.
still need to practice some more , especially on post , put and delete. 
having some issues with Route prams , which means i have to go back and practice it more and review it.
tried runing some request with route params but there was an error , i need to look at what that bug is and fix it.
This is all part of the game , the complicated things just make me stronger.

KEEP GOING DONT STOP!!!

12-feb
new weeklets goooo!!!
starting by reviewing all i have done so far then after i will handle any issues i am facing.
some if the issues i have mentioned earlier.
fixed the error with my Route params , just need to practice more so i get a hang of it.
loll sometimes developing is like going from one hard thing to another , crazy.
i need to go back and look at how to handle delete request from the front-end , passing it into a featch API function then handle it again from the back-end.

13-feb
more practice !!
Done with learning more Node AND Express with netninja.
now its time to practice more using everything i have learnt soo far , improve with practice and build with practice.
Constant practice and building is the only way things will stay in my head lol.

14-feb
practice !!!!
practice !!!!
practice !!!
IF IT WAS EASY EVERYONE WILL BE DOING IT!!
Undersstand the basics of code and impliment it in different ways.
i need to build more let my workk speak for itself that way people will know what i can do.

15-feb 
Another day of practice.
On another 8hr dose.
crazy day still putting some hours in.
Having little issues with my handers View engine , need to figure it out soon because it is slowing me down , but i am learning in the process of the struggle.

16-feb
Review my code on the SAFETY-AID and find out why my index.ejs file is not working. 
sometimes code just really annoys the shit out of me , expeciially when trying to figure things out and ut is not working.
Also debugging is very annoying.
But this is the life , have to keep going and doing hard things.

17-feb
Another day another dose , lets gooo!
still on express , trying to put more practice in and build something so it sticks.

18-feb

not really doing much today just light work and then just chill and prepare for the new weeks daily dose.
All server for all my projectss working now. might host the servers or maybe not.
Next is to setup mobile screens for all my projects because i only have laptop screens setup.

19-feb
new week new 8hr daily dose .
keep going , dont stop , it will get hard but you just cant STOP!!
