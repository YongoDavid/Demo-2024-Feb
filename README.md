learning new things while diving deeper into node.js , learnt more about operating systems (os) and file systems (fs)
and also a different way to import and export modules , using tthe destructuring way which will take some time to get used to

active  at 5am on my for my 8hour daily dose.
refreshed on how to create servers with node and express and , i have been using node but extress seems much more better and easier ,even the syntax 
also my nodemon finally running as it should , i was using the wrong syntax anyways , and now i know the right way to do it , which again makes restarting servers easier 
did not know how to handle redirection , now i know how to in both node and express.
the major thing to do now is practice , practice , practice , i can only get better by actuallly do it instead of just studing and knowing 

6-feb
another 8hour daily dose.

learning about view engines , which allow me use javasctipt in html , i would say it is a bit better than html.
it is helpful but i dont think it is required all the time , i might use it to build a full project soon without html and see how it goes
the engine view i have use so far is (ejs) there are three others like pug , handlebers etc.
also learnt partials

8-feb 
learnt about middlewares , they are codes that run through req ,and response , reguardless of thier routes 
you have to be careful when using middlewares m because they run from top to buttom.
ALso learnt about thrid party middleswares , they are expternal middle packages that help us carry out certian functions , examples validation , logging and many others.
learnt about "static" function that help us explicitly set out static files and images so our server can read them and use them.
