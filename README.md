# Demo-2024-Feb
1-feb
Welcome to the new month in the year 2024 , LETS GO HARDER THAN LAST MONTH , AND BUILD MORE!!.

Going to continue with the e-commerce project this month just to make sure pending issues are resolved then after move forward 
My main Goal for this month is to focus on back-end and go deeper into back-end , maybe learn a little bit of react as well ,and prompt enginnering.
Well there is alot to do this year and this month, wish me luck. 

2-feb
i have decided to spread my time and increase my work hours his month steping up from 3 to 5 hours daily to 8 hours daily , lets see how that goes
also got my updates here i am going to atarting adding dates to my updates just incase i need to come back to something and need to remember the days i updated.

3-feb
its a new day lets get more work done and figure out the signup and loggin UI issue with my e-commerce site
login and signup still not working on UI only through API tesing from API, will just leave it that way and come back to it 
now i will go back to study node.js and understand more about it.
learning new things while diving deeper into node.js , learnt more about operating systems (os) and file systems (fs)
and also a different way to import and export modules , using tthe destructuring way which will take some time to get used to 
learnt aomething new also called streams and buffers , also pipe which is in relation to these two things  
this is just a brief. 

4-feb
not doing much today , just reviewing all my notes that i have taken , both in my books and on my note pad 
gathering some strenght to begin my 8 hours again , lets go crazy ths new week because there wlnt be another week like this again. 

5-feb
active  at 5am on my for my 8hour daily dose.
refreshed on how to create servers with node and express and , i have been using node but extress seems much more better and easier ,even the syntax. 
also my nodemon finally running as it should , i was using the wrong syntax anyways , and now i know the right way to do it , which again makes restarting servers easier 
did not know how to handle redirection , now i know how to in both node and express.
the major thing to do now is practice , practice , practice , i can only get better by actuallly do it instead of just studing and knowing. 

6-feb
another 8hour daily dose. 

7-feb 
learning about view engines , which allow me use javasctipt in html , i would say it is a bit better than html.
it is helpful but i dont think it is required all the time , i might use it to build a full project soon without html and see how it goes
the engine view i have use so far is (ejs) there are three others like pug , handlebers etc.
also learnt partials.

8-feb 
learnt about middlewares , they are codes that run through req ,and response , reguardless of thier routes 
you have to be careful when using middlewares because they run from top to buttom.
Also learnt about 3rd party middleswares , they are external middle packages that help us carry out certian functions , examples validation , logging and many others.
learnt about "static" function that help us explicitly set out static files and images so our server can read them and use them.

9-feb
learning a new databse (MongooDB) , it is a Non SQlL database.
it is a bit similar but different from MySQL database , it has different terminologies and and concepts behind it.
Some of the terminologies behind it are , Collections , Schemas , and Models.
One of the reasons i am enjoying working with MongoDB is , it is the first Cloud based Databse i am working with (MongoDB Atlas).
When working with MongoDB there is 3rd party package we work with and it is called mongoose (funny right) now lets practice. 

10-feb
MongoDB going well so far , been practicing and trying to use it often. 
i dont need to master the syntax of code because there is so much to learn , just understand the syntax and the basics. 
i will work with soo many new technologies so trying to know every syntax would be stressful
so each new techonolgy i learn i just need too practice it often and it will stick then understand the basics main function of how it works and its basics. 
practice makes perfect , still need to figure out why my data is not sending to the right collection / database on my cloud database.

11-feb
taking a little break today , to gather a strenght for another 8hr daily dose.
still need to practice some more , especially on post , put and delete. 
having some issues with Route prams , which means i have to go back and practice it more and review it.
tried runing some request with route params but there was an error , i need to look at what that bug is and fix it.
This is all part of the game , the complicated things just make me stronger.

KEEP GOING DONT STOP!!!

12-feb
new weeklets goooo!!!
starting by reviewing all i have done so far then after i will handle any issues i am facing.
some if the issues i have mentioned earlier.
fixed the error with my Route params , just need to practice more so i get a hang of it.
loll sometimes developing is like going from one hard thing to another , crazy.
i need to go back and look at how to handle delete request from the front-end , passing it into a featch API function then handle it again from the back-end.

13-feb
more practice !!
Done with learning more Node AND Express with netninja.
now its time to practice more using everything i have learnt soo far , improve with practice and build with practice.
Constant practice and building is the only way things will stay in my head lol.

14-feb
practice !!!!
practice !!!!
practice !!!
IF IT WAS EASY EVERYONE WILL BE DOING IT!!
Undersstand the basics of code and impliment it in different ways.
i need to build more let my workk speak for itself that way people will know what i can do.

15-feb 
Another day oof practice.
On another 8hr dose
